Project Title

Detailed Report on Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Simulation Using Cisco Packet Tracer
Overview

This project provides a comprehensive, step-by-step report on the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) simulation conducted in Cisco Packet Tracer. The report explains ARP fundamentals, the setup and execution of the simulation with PCs numbered PC1 to PC8 assigned IP addresses 10.0.0.1 through 10.0.0.8, ARP packet details, cache behavior, and network communication flow.
Purpose

The report is designed to serve as an educational resource for students, network administrators, and IT professionals to understand the ARP mechanism in a local area network. It visually and textually demonstrates the interaction between IP and MAC addressing and highlights how dynamic IP-to-MAC mapping occurs in practical networking scenarios.
