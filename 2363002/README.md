# Project Title: Simple LAN and ARP Demo

## **Aim**
To construct a simple LAN and demonstrate the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) operation using [Arduino/Cisco Packet Tracer].

## **Results**
- Successfully established communication between devices in the LAN.
- Demonstrated ARP request and reply using [Serial Monitor/Packet Tracer simulation].
- Verified ARP table's response to network communication.

## **How to Use**
1. Open the project file (`.ino` or `.pkt`) in [Arduino IDE or Cisco Packet Tracer].
2. Follow the instructions in the report or README for setup and testing.
